# Folder Naming Conventions

A collection of notes on how to name and organize folders in a React project.

---

> ### /src/components
This folder contains all the components in your react app. In a simple and barebones app, (like a todo app) there should be no need to create subfolders like layout or other folders.

> ### /src/components/layout
The layout folder contains all React components related to the layout of the app.
e.g. Navigation.jsx

> ### /src/pages
The pages folder contain all the router pages in your app. They are different from components.
